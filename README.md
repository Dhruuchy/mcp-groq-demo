## Introduction

Model-Centric Programming (MCP) emphasizes the importance of models in the software development process. This project integrates LangChain and Groq to facilitate the creation of an autonomous CRUD agent. With this setup, you can efficiently manage data operations while leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

## Features

- **Autonomous CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations automatically.
- **Integration with LangChain**: Utilize LangChain for building language model applications.
- **Groq Support**: Leverage Groq for efficient querying and data manipulation.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Interact with the agent through a simple command-line interface.
- **SQLite Database**: Store and manage data using SQLite.

## Technologies Used

This project employs the following technologies:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **Groq**: A query language for efficient data retrieval.
- **Llama3**: A state-of-the-art large language model.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database engine for data storage.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for processing and analyzing human language.

## Installation

To get started with the MCP Groq Demo, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhruuchy/mcp-groq-demo.git
   cd mcp-groq-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Dhruuchy/mcp-groq-demo/releases) section to download the latest version. Extract the files and navigate to the extracted directory.

## Usage

To run the autonomous CRUD agent, use the command-line interface. Hereâ€™s how to start:

```bash
python main.py
```

You can then interact with the agent using various commands to perform CRUD operations. For a list of available commands, type:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

## Examples

### Create Operation

To create a new entry, use the following command:

```bash
python main.py create --name "Sample Entry" --data "This is a sample data."
```

### Read Operation

To read existing entries, use:

```bash
python main.py read --id 1
```

### Update Operation

To update an entry, use:

```bash
python main.py update --id 1 --data "Updated data."
```

### Delete Operation

To delete an entry, use:

```bash
python main.py delete --id 1
```
